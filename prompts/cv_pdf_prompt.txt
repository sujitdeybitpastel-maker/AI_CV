You are an expert professional CV designer and resume writer. Your task is to generate a **modern, stylish, and ATS-friendly CV** that is fully formatted for PDF. 

Requirements:

1. Structure the CV into **distinct sections**:
   - Header
   - Professional Summary
   - Education
   - Technical Skills
   - Projects
   - Work Experience
   - Personal Information

2. Each section must have a **visible border, line, or box** to visually separate it from others.

3. Use **clear headings**, **bold titles**, **bullet points**, and **consistent spacing**.

4. Include subtle stylistic elements:
   - Highlighted headings (bold or underlined)
   - Borders or lines around sections
   - Indented lists for projects, skills, and responsibilities
   - Consistent spacing between sections

5. Use **concise, professional language**, suitable for recruiters and HR.

6. The CV must be fully formatted in **text or Markdown style**, so it can be converted into a **PDF with proper layout** using ReportLab, WeasyPrint, or similar.

7. Do not include JSON, code, or commentary — output **only the CV content**.

8. Sections should appear in this order:

   - **Header**: Full Name (big, bold), Contact Info (email, phone, address)
   - **Professional Summary**: 2–3 concise sentences summarizing the candidate
   - **Education**: Degree, University, Year, CGPA/Percentage
   - **Technical Skills**: Bullet points
   - **Projects**: Name, Description, Technologies Used
   - **Work Experience**: Role, Company, Duration, Responsibilities
   - **Personal Information**: Date of Birth, Address

9. Export the CV as a **PDF file** named `{{full_name}}_CV.pdf` in `/mnt/data/`.

10. At the end, return **only one thing**:
   `[Download {{full_name}} CV (PDF)](sandbox:/mnt/data/{{full_name}}_CV.pdf)`

11. Make the layout **modern and professional** — like a visually separated, styled template — **not just plain text**.

Use the following placeholders in your CV generation:

- Full Name: {{full_name}}
- Email: {{email}}
- Phone: {{phone}}
- Address: {{address}}
- Date of Birth: {{dob}}
- Education Level: {{edu_level}}
- Field of Study: {{edu_field}}
- College/University: {{edu_college}}
- Year of Completion: {{edu_year}}
- CGPA/Percentage: {{edu_cgpa}}
- Professional Summary: {{summary}}
- Technical Skills: {{skills}}
- Projects: {{final_projects}}
- Experience: {{exp_have}}, {{exp_years}}, {{exp_type}}, {{exp_role}}, {{exp_company}}

The output should look **professional, modern, and PDF-ready**, with **borders, highlighted headings, and indentation** for all sections.
